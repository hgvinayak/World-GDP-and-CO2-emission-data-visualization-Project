---**Machine Learning Project: Analyzing CO2 Emissions and GDP Trends in Australia**
        This project focuses on analyzing CO2 emissions (per capita) and GDP values over the years in various countries. For   this analysis, we have selected Australia as our primary focus. The dataset comprises a list of countries around the world along with associated indicators over the years.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to explore the trends in CO2 emissions and GDP in Australia over the years, employing machine learning techniques and data visualization methods.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information on various countries and their respective indicators over the years. For this project, we are particularly interested in CO2 emissions and GDP data for Australia.

**Analysis:**
We will begin by selecting Australia and analyzing its CO2 emissions over the years. Additionally, we will explore the GDP trends to understand any correlations or patterns between CO2 emissions and economic growth.

**Data Visualization**
Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding patterns and trends in the dataset. We will utilize various visualization techniques such as line charts, scatter plots, and bar graphs to represent CO2 emissions and GDP values over time in Australia.

**Conclusion**
Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP in Australia and present our findings through clear and informative visualizations.
